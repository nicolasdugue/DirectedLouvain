/*! \class Graph 
 * \brief   Class handling directed graphs. 
 *          Graphs are read from edgelist or binary formats and stored using [CSR](https://github.com/nicolasdugue/DirectedLouvain/tree/c+%2B11#CSR) format.
 *
 *          Nodes are renumbered unless stated otherwise, and the resulting correspondance is built.    
 *          Outcoming and incoming arcs are represented using cumulative degree sequences and a list of 
 *          both out- and in-neighbors and the corresponding weights.
